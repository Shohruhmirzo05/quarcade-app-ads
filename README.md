QuarCade Privacy Policy
Last updated: September 17, 2025

Overview
QuarCade is a casual arcade app. We do not require an account, and your gameplay data (scores, progress, settings) is stored on your device. We show ads using Google AdMob, which may collect certain device and usage data to serve and measure ads. This policy explains what we collect, how it’s used, and your choices.

Data We Collect

On-device gameplay data
• Scores, progress, and in-app settings are stored locally on your device.
• We do not maintain our own cloud database of your gameplay.


Advertising and measurement data (Google AdMob)
• Identifiers: device identifiers such as IDFA/IDFV (subject to your iOS tracking choices).
• Approximate location: may be inferred from your IP address to help select relevant ads and for fraud prevention.
• Usage/interaction: ad impressions, taps, and related performance metrics.
• Diagnostics & fraud prevention: data used to keep ads reliable and prevent abuse.


AdMob collects and processes this information in accordance with Google’s policies:
• Google AdMob: https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads
• Google Privacy Policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy

How We Use Data
• Provide and operate app features (saving scores and settings).
• Serve and measure advertising through Google AdMob (frequency capping, impression counting, performance).
• Improve stability and performance.
We do not sell your personal data.

Data Sharing
• We share data with service providers necessary to operate the app, specifically Google AdMob for advertising and measurement.
• We do not share your contact information because we do not collect it.
• AdMob may process data as an independent controller in line with its own privacy policy.

Tracking, Personalization, and Your Choices
• App Tracking Transparency (ATT): On iOS, you can choose whether to allow ad tracking. If you select “Don’t Allow,” we will not permit access to the IDFA for personalized ads. You can change this anytime in iOS Settings > Privacy & Security > Tracking.
• Reset or limit ad identifiers: Adjust settings in Settings > Privacy & Security > Tracking.
• Regional consent (e.g., GDPR): Depending on your region, you may see consent dialogs that let you choose personalized or non-personalized ads.
• Apple Advertising controls: You can limit Apple’s ad personalization in Settings > Privacy & Security > Apple Advertising.

Data Storage and Retention
• Gameplay data remains on your device until you delete it or uninstall the app.
• Ad data collected by Google is retained by Google according to its policies.
• We do not operate our own analytics or user accounts.

Children’s Privacy
QuarCade is a general-audience app and is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided personal information, contact us and we will address the issue promptly.

International Data Transfers
Google AdMob may process data on servers outside your country of residence. For details on international transfers and applicable safeguards, see Google’s privacy documentation.

Security
We use iOS platform protections and reasonable technical measures to safeguard data handled by the app. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
