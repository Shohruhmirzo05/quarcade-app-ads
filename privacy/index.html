  <h1>Privacy Policy & Contact</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> September 17, 2025</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>QuarCade is a casual arcade app. We do not require an account, and your gameplay data
  (scores, progress, settings) is stored on your device. We show ads using Google AdMob,
  which may collect certain device and usage data to serve and measure ads. This policy explains
  what we collect, how it’s used, and your choices.</p>

  <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>On-device gameplay data:</strong> Scores, progress, and in-app settings are stored locally.</li>
    <li><strong>Advertising and measurement data (Google AdMob):</strong> Device identifiers (IDFA/IDFV),
    approximate location (from IP), usage & interactions (ad impressions, taps), diagnostics & fraud prevention.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>AdMob collects and processes this information in accordance with Google’s policies:
    <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads">Google AdMob</a>,
    <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google Privacy Policy</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>How We Use Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide and operate app features (saving scores and settings).</li>
    <li>Serve and measure advertising through Google AdMob.</li>
    <li>Improve app stability and performance.</li>
    <li>We do not sell your personal data.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We share data with service providers necessary to operate the app, specifically Google AdMob for
  advertising and measurement. We do not share your contact information because we do not collect it.
  AdMob may process data independently in line with its own privacy policy.</p>

  <h2>Tracking & Your Choices</h2>
  <p>On iOS, you can choose whether to allow ad tracking via App Tracking Transparency (ATT).
  If you deny tracking, QuarCade will not access the IDFA for personalized ads.
  You can reset or limit ad identifiers anytime in iOS Settings &gt; Privacy & Security &gt; Tracking.
  Apple Advertising personalization can also be limited in iOS settings.</p>

  <h2>Data Storage & Retention</h2>
  <p>Gameplay data remains on your device until you delete or uninstall the app.
  Ad data collected by Google is retained according to Google’s own policies.
  We do not operate our own analytics or user accounts.</p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>QuarCade is a general-audience app and is not directed at children under 13.
  We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.
  If you believe a child has provided personal information, please contact us and we will address it promptly.</p>

  <h2>International Transfers</h2>
  <p>Google AdMob may process data on servers outside your country of residence.
  For details, see Google’s privacy documentation.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>We use iOS platform protections and reasonable technical measures to safeguard data handled by the app.
  However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy to reflect changes to the app or legal requirements.
  The “Last updated” date above will always indicate the most recent version.</p>
