Quick summary

We collect the minimum necessary to run our apps, improve performance, and keep things secure.

Our apps may show ads and use analytics; those partners may process device identifiers and usage data.

We don’t sell personal data.

You can control permissions (notifications, tracking, Game Center) in your device settings.

What we collect

1) Information you provide

Contact details you send us (e.g., email, name, message) via forms or support.

Content you submit in feedback or surveys.

2) Information collected automatically

Device and app data: device model, OS version, app version, language, time zone, performance metrics, and crash logs.

Usage data: screens viewed, features used, session timing, and basic interaction events.

3) Information from platform services (when enabled)

Game Center: display name, player ID, leaderboard and achievement activity. We don’t receive your real name or email from Game Center.

Push notifications: a device token that allows us to send notifications to your device.

Advertising identifiers: IDFA (iOS) when you grant permission, used for ad frequency capping, fraud prevention, and personalization depending on your choices.
